Speckled Laser Profile
======================

Implements speckled lasers for studying laser-plasma interactions in fusion and ion acceleration contexts.
A speckled laser beam is a laser that is deliberately divided transversely into several beamlets in the near-field.
This is obtained with a phase plate divided into
This phase plate provides a different phase to each beamlet, which then propagate incoherently to the far field.
This profile admits several options for calculating the amplitudes and phases of the beamlets.
This is the adapation of work by `Han Wen <https://github.com/Wen-Han/LasersSmoothing2d>`__ to LASY.
