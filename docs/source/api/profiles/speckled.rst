Speckled Laser Profile
======================

Implements speckled lasers for studying laser-plasma interactions in fusion and ion acceleration contexts.
This profile admits several options depending on how the amplitudes and phases of the beamlets are determined.
This is the adapation of work by `Han Wen <https://github.com/Wen-Han/LasersSmoothing2d>`__ to LASY.
