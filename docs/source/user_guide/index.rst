Installation
############

To install the code you will need to first clone the repository to your local machine.
Change into the new directory and then run the install command as given below.

..  code-block:: bash
    :caption: Installation Instructions

    git clone https://github.com/LASY-org/lasy.git
    cd lasy
    python3 -m pip install -v .

More installation options and further instructions will be added in due course.


First Example
#############
We will try a simple example to get familiar with the code structure and to verify the installation was successful.
Lets generate a Gaussian pulse at focus, propagate it backwards by one Rayeligh Length and then output it to file.

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: First lets load in the required functions from the library.

   from lasy.profiles.gaussian_profile import GaussianProfile


..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Next, define the physical parameters of the laser pulse and create the laser profile object.

   wavelength     = 800e-9  # Laser wavelength in meters
   polarization   = (1,0)   # Linearly polarized in the x direction
   energy         = 1.5     # Energy of the laser pulse in joules
   spot_size      = 25e-6   # Waist of the laser pulse in meters
   pulse_duration = 30e-15  # Pulse duration of the laser in seconds
   t_peak         = 0.0     # Location of the peak of the laser pulse in time

   laser_profile = GaussianProfile(wavelength,polarization,energy,spot_size,pulse_duration,t_peak)

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Now create a full laser object containing the above physical parameters together with the computational settings.

   dimensions     = 'rt'                              # Use cylindrical geometry
   lo             = (0,-2.5*pulse_duration)           # Lower bounds of the simulation box
   hi             = (5*spot_size,2.5*pulse_duration)  # Upper bounds of the simulation box
   num_points     = (300,500)                         # Number of points in each dimension

   laser = Laser(dimensions,lo,hi,num_points,laser_profile)

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Propagate the laser pulse backwards by one Rayeligh length.

   z_R            = 3.14159*spot_size**2/wavelength    # The Rayleigh length.
   laser.propagate(-z_R)

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Output the result to file. Here we utilise the openPMD standard.

   file_prefix    = 'test_output' # The file name will start with this prefix
   file_format    = 'h5'          # Format to be used for the output file

   write_to_openpmd_file(dimensions, file_prefix, file_format, laser.field, wavelength, polarization)

This file may now be viewed, copied, shared or used as an input to a variety of other simulation tools.
