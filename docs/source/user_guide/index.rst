Installation

..  code-block:: bash
    :caption: Installation Instructions

    python -m pip install lasy

First Example
#############

We will try a simple example to get familiar with the code structure and to verify the installation was successful.
Let's generate a Gaussian pulse at focus, propagate it backwards by one Rayleigh length (the pulse is then located upstream of the focal plane) and then output it to a file.

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: First lets load in the required functions from the library.

   from lasy.profiles.gaussian_profile import GaussianProfile
   from lasy.laser import Laser


..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Next, define the physical parameters of the laser pulse and create the laser profile object.

   wavelength     = 800e-9  # Laser wavelength in meters
   polarization   = (1,0)   # Linearly polarized in the x direction
   energy         = 1.5     # Energy of the laser pulse in joules
   spot_size      = 25e-6   # Waist of the laser pulse in meters
   pulse_duration = 30e-15  # Pulse duration of the laser in seconds
   t_peak         = 0.0     # Location of the peak of the laser pulse in time

   laser_profile = GaussianProfile(wavelength,polarization,energy,spot_size,pulse_duration,t_peak)

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Now create a full laser object containing the above physical parameters together with the computational settings.

   dimensions     = 'rt'                              # Use cylindrical geometry
   lo             = (0,-2.5*pulse_duration)           # Lower bounds of the simulation box
   hi             = (5*spot_size,2.5*pulse_duration)  # Upper bounds of the simulation box
   num_points     = (300,500)                         # Number of points in each dimension

   laser = Laser(dimensions,lo,hi,num_points,laser_profile)

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: By default, the values of the laser envelope are injected on the focal plan. One can propagate it backwards by one Rayleigh length (optional).

   z_R            = 3.14159*spot_size**2/wavelength    # The Rayleigh length
   laser.propagate(-z_R)                               # Propagate the pulse upstream of the focal plane

..  code-block:: python
   :caption: Output the result to a file. Here we utilise the openPMD standard.

   file_prefix    = 'test_output' # The file name will start with this prefix
   file_format    = 'h5'          # Format to be used for the output file

   laser.write_to_file(file_prefix, file_format)

The generated file may now be viewed or used as a laser input to a variety of other simulation tools.
