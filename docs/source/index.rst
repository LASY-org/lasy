LASY |release| Documentation
============================

``lasy`` (LAser SYmple manipulator) is a Python library that facilitates the initialization of complex laser pulses, in simulations of laser-plasma interactions.

More specifically, ``lasy`` offers many ways to define complex laser pulses (e.g. from commonly-known analytical formulas, from experimental measurements, etc.) and offers pre-processing functionalities (e.g. propagation, re-normalization, geometry conversion).
The laser field is then exported in a standardized file, that can be read by external simulation codes.

The code is open-source and hosted on `github <https://github.com/LASY-org/lasy>`__. Contributions are welcome!
