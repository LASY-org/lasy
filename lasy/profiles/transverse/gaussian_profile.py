class GaussianTransverseProfile(TransverseProfile):
    r"""
    Derived class for the analytic profile of a Gaussian laser pulse.

    More precisely, at focus (``z_foc=0``), the transverse envelope
    (to be used in the :class:`.CombinedLongitudinalTransverseLaser` class)
    corresponds to:

    .. math::

        \mathcal{T}(x, y) = \exp\left( -\frac{x^2 + y^2}{w_0^2} \right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    w0 : float (in meter)
        The waist of the laser pulse, i.e. :math:`w_0` in the above formula.

    wavelength : float (in meter), optional
        The main laser wavelength :math:`\lambda_0` of the laser.
        (Only needed if ``z_foc`` is different than 0.)

    z_foc : float (in meter), optional
        Position of the focal plane. (The laser pulse is initialized at
        ``z=0``.)

    Warnings
    --------
    In order to initialize the pulse out of focus, you can either:

    - Use a non-zero ``z_foc``
    - Use ``z_foc=0`` (i.e. initialize the pulse at focus) and then call
      ``laser.propagate(-z_foc)``

    Both methods are in principle equivalent, but note that the first
    method uses the paraxial approximation, while the second method does
    not make this approximation.
